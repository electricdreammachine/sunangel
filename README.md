Just a simple eBay listing template.

Just pulls together some really simple design concepts to make a clean eBay product listing:
- constrains content to a max-width container, keeps line measure down to help with readability
- increases line-height slightly to put a bit of vertical rhythm into copy
- light branding

Doesn't do anything particularly exciting, but compiles to play nicely with eBay displaying ads in iframes and with certain styles inherited.
